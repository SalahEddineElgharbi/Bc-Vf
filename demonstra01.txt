So we have :

>>>> 4 managers
>>>> Blockchain for : 7 blocks


>>>> X IoT device (Sensor)



>>>>> and now, we will increase the number of Attacker (the number actaul its 1 attackers)  >>>>> 


So when, the number of attacke (more or eqauls)=> number managers >>>> we will see the reaction from VTA process by eliming all of them and stiill provide the realible network




















Now, when we increaase the number of attackres to meet 51% attaque and break BC :
 




**************************** we add
Attacker 6002 with his sensor 
++++
+++
++
+


>>>>> and we we still that the number of blocks added its the same : --------  BLOCK N= 7--------


So we have, 4 Managers and 5 attackers, but with VTA process we see that :



Manager 6001 :1
Manager 6002 :1
Manager 6003 :1


CF = 1 just when he new when is join to the network, after that, do not increase



at high class :
Rank_A: 4432
Rank_A: 4434

so we take Randomly to avoid the ... (priort one with others) with R_A of >  80% high


So he chose >> MG 4432 >>>
 Conflit : true
Manager_RES_NEGAIVE

So the block >> Rejected and we have :

The Ratio is: 0
Return validate_new_block: false




if we add more attackers >>  20   and the number of manager still 5 >> the network still realible and more then that this attacker >>> elliminte
